# R MIEF Skills Workshop

## Session 1

### January 12, 2026

---

## Introduction

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Purpose]

### Purpose of this course: Put you on the right track to use R for data or policy analysis.

- As data work has become near-ubiquitous in the research/policy world, so have basic tasks like aggregating, analyzing, summarizing, and visualizing data.

- **The vast majority** of research assistant/analyst (RA) work consists of cleaning and constructing datasets for analysis

- **Entry-level RA positions rarely require complex econometric/regression skills**

]

.panel[.panel-name[Learning R]

### You should think of learning R like learning a language.

- Taking a six-hour course won't make you proficient in it

- If you don't practice it, you'll forget it

- Solution — **Find ways to use R in your life, either personally or professionally**

]

## Why R?

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Jobs]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
- Many entry-level research jobs in policy, economic, development, or political science institutions now expect quantitative work using Stata, R, or Python

- Coding skills make you more valuable in any position — data adds value to nearly every kind of research!

## Think As A Coder

### Recipe Analogy

.content-box-red[
- Your data are your ingredients
- Your script is your recipe
- Your output is your... cake? Whatever you're making
]

.content-box-blue[
What this means:
- **Make sure you have all of the ingredients you need.**
- **Follow every step of the recipe — you can't skip any steps!**
- If you mess up somewhere, you have to start from scratch to make sure that you get the correct outcome.
]

- Outputs
]
]

.pull-right[
.content-box-blue[
&lt;b&gt;Questions to ask:&lt;/b&gt;
- Where is the file stored?
- In which format is the file?
- How easy is it for you/other people to access it?
- Is it intuitive for you to navigate to the file?

]

## R Basics

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Scalars]

This is a scalar:


``` r
a &lt;- 2
```

It's an object (`a`) with a single value (`2`). Notice that we assign the value `2` to `a` using an arrow `&lt;-`.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Vectors]

These are vectors:


``` r
vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 5)
vector
```

```
## [1] 1 2 5
```


``` r
vector &lt;- 2:6
vector
```

```
## [1] 2 3 4 5 6
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[More Vectors]

These are more vectors:


``` r
vector &lt;- seq(2, 3, by = 0.5)
vector
```

```
## [1] 2.0 2.5 3.0
```

Vectors take multiple values. Notice that vectors have a specific **order**: `c(1, 2)` is not the same as `c(2, 1)`.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Selecting Vector Elements]


``` r
## By Position

x[4]       # Fourth element

x[-4]      # Everything but the fourth element

x[2:4]     # Elements two to four

x[-(2:4)]  # Everything but elements two to four

x[c(1, 5)] # Elements one and five
```


``` r
# By Value

x[x == 10]           # Elements which are equal to 10

x[x &lt; 0]             # Elements that are less than zero

x[x %in% c(1, 2, 5)] # Elements in the set 1, 2, 5
```

]
  
]

---

## R Basics

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Lists]

This is a list:


``` r
y &lt;- list("a", 1, "b")
```

Lists are different from vectors in one key manner: **they can take objects of different classes**. Vectors can only take objects of the same class.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Some Classes]

Here are some classes in R:


``` r
a &lt;- "a"    # Character
b &lt;- 1      # Integer
c &lt;- 1.2    # Numeric
d &lt;- 1 + 2i # Complex
e &lt;- TRUE   # Logical
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Data Frames]

This is a data frame:


``` r
df &lt;- data.frame(
    first_name = c("Mark", "Mary", "July"),
    last_name  = c("Smith", "John", "Sanchez"),
    age        = c(21, 34, 55)
)
```

At their core, data frames are just a group of named vectors of the same length.
In practice, we visualize data frames as **tables** where each vector is a **column**, or variable, and each group of nth elements of the vectors is a **row**, or observation.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Assignment vs. Printing]

KEY — We can classify the code we write in our script into two general categories:

1- Assignment code. We are **assigning** a value to an object:

``` r
a &lt;- 2
```

2- Printing code. We are **printing** an object's value:

``` r
a
```

```
## [1] 2
```



``` r
print(a)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

**Only 2- results in something appearing in your console. When you assign a value to an object, nothing prints in the console.**

]

]

---

## R Basics

NOTE — R works in a manner that allows to write a specific function over multiple lines. This is called a **code chunk**.

This:

``` r
a &lt;- mean(c(seq(1, 4, by = 0.5)))

a
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

Is the same as this:

``` r
a &lt;- mean(
    c(
        seq(1, 4, by = 0.5)
    )
)

a
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

---

## R Basics

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Functions]

Like in mathematics, a function is an expression or rule that takes an input, or *argument*, and returns an *output*. A function is any `f` such that `f(x) = y`.

In R, functions take the following form:


``` r
# The function is called
sum_function &lt;- function(x, y) { # x and y are the function's arguments
    x + y # Within the brackets {}, we define the function's output
}

sum_function(2, 3)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

The vast majority of using R is done using functions, either included with R or written by external users. For instance, to find the sum of 2 and 3, we can use the "base R" function `sum()`.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Packages]

A package is a bundle of functions created by external users. They innovate and, in many cases, improve upon base R functions. Most work in R is done using functions from external packages.

We will look at how to install and load packages shortly. Examples of commonly-used packages are `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stringr`, `ggplot2`, and `data.table`.

]

]

---

## R Basics

You can click anywhere in the code chunk and click "run" or Cmd+Enter (Mac)/Ctrl+Enter (Windows), and the whole chunk will run.

KEY — If you only select a portion of the code chunk and run that, then R will identify the chunk as unfinished and refuse to let you do anything else until you've "completed" it.

# Coding Set Up

---

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Installing Packages]

Packages are groups of user-created functions that help us accomplish tasks that would be harder/impossible using base R functions.

### Easy


``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

### Better

The `pacman` package installs packages if they aren't installed yet, loads them otherwise


``` r
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Setting up File Paths]

File paths help R identify where the files you want to use are located.

You want your code to be **reproducible** and **easy to use by other people**

Simple solution: Create an `.rproj` file that people can open to access your R environment

Better solution:


``` r
# Set User (this allows us to use fixed file paths but to adapt them
# for multiple possible users)
      # 1 — Marc-Andrea Fiorina
      # 2 — Enter here if needed
  
user &lt;- 1
  
if(user == 1) {
    # Absolute file path
    main_filepath &lt;- "/Users/marc-andreafiorina/Dropbox/SAIS R Course/"
}

# Notice the relative file paths
data_filepath &lt;- paste0(main_filepath, "data/")
```

]

]

# Importing Data

---

class: middle

Easiest file type to import into R is a .csv file. But you can also import .xlsx, .dta (Stata), etc.

- Easy `-&gt;` `read.csv()`
- Harder (faster) `-&gt;` `data.table::fread()`


``` r
norms_values_data &lt;- data.table::fread(
    "raw/wvs_values_norms_data.csv",
    na.strings = ""
)
```

Note the construction of the "harder" method, with the "`::`". This is used to refer to the package from which the function originates. The structure is `package::function()`.

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Data Not Loading

&lt;img src="pics/data_not_loading1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


&lt;img src="pics/data_not_loading2.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Data Not Loading

Check:
- Working directory — `getwd()` or check the top of the RStudio console.
- File path — are there any typos? Is your file where you expect it to be?

Solutions:
- If you were provided with an `.Rproj` file alongside your script, make sure that you opened the project.
- Modify the working directory using `setwd()` or correct the file path if need be!

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Function Not Found

&lt;img src="pics/function_not_found.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Function Not Found

Check:
- From which package the function comes. You can do this using `??FUNCTION NAME` (e.g. `??tabyl`) or through a Google search.
- That the package is (1) installed in your environment and (2) loaded. Having the package installed isn't sufficient!

Solutions:
- If the package isn't installed, use `install.packages("tabyl")`. If the package isn't loaded, use `library(tabyl)` or `pacman::p_load(tabyl)`.

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Code Not Running

&lt;img src="pics/code_not_running.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Code Not Running

Check:
- That you didn't miss a parenthesis (`)`) or bracket (`}`) in your code! This is the most common reason.
- If you missed it, the console will show a `+` at the start of the console line instead of the expected `&gt;`.

Solutions:
- Type gibberish and/or the missing parenthesis/bracket until the `&gt;` reappears. More likely, you'll have to rerun the code chunk to make sure it works!

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Object Not Found

&lt;img src="pics/object_not_found.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Basic Issues in RStudio
### Object Not Found

Check:
- Whether the object exists in your environment. More likely than not, you either misspelt the name of the object, or you skipped the code that creates it (remember that a script is like a recipe and steps can't be skipped!).

Solutions:
- Backtrack in your code and run the chunk that creates the object.
- If a typo is at fault, correct the typo.

## Practical Exercise
### Using the World Values Survey Dataset

---
&lt;font size='+3'&gt;&lt;b&gt;World Values Survey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font size='+2'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
*"The survey, which started in 1981, seeks to use the most rigorous, high-quality research designs in each country. The WVS consists of nationally representative surveys conducted in almost 100 countries which contain almost 90 percent of the world’s population, using a common questionnaire. [...] WVS seeks to help scientists and policy makers understand changes in the beliefs, values and motivations of people throughout the world."*

&lt;font size='+2'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey Contents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
.pull-left[
- Social values, attitudes &amp; stereotypes
- Societal well-being
- Social capital, trust and organizational membership
- Economic values
- Corruption
- Migration
- Post-materialist index
]

.pull-right[
- Science &amp; technology
- Religious values
- Security
- Ethical values &amp; norms
- Political interest and political participation
- Political culture and political regimes
- Demography
]

---

### Today's practical component

1— Download the World Values Survey (Wave 7) at this link: [https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp)

2— Set up your data analysis folder. Make sure that it contains the following folders:
  - data
      - raw
      - intermediate
  - code
  - output
  - documentation
    
3— Place the data and documentation files that you find appropriate for your analysis in the corresponding folders.

4— Open RStudio and click on "New Project" in the "File" dropdown menu. Navigate to your data folder and select it.

---

### Today's practical component

5— Set up your R Script. It should have the following components:
  - Package setup. For now, have the script load the `dplyr`, `data.table`, and `skimr` packages.
  - Data import. Import your data into the script using `read.csv()` or `fread()`. Remember to give your data frame an intuitive name!
    
6— Test your R Script. Type and run the following line in your code: `skim([[DATASETNAME]])`.
&lt;br&gt;**Replace [[DATASETNAME]] with the name you gave your dataset.** If this works without issue, you're free to take a break!

## Data Visualization — Descriptive Statistics — Plots

---

## Descriptive Stats Plots

`ggplot2` is the gold standard in data visualization in data work. It's one of the main reason that people use R over other programming languages.

Very simple syntax and allows you to add elements very easily.

You can use `ggplot2` to create any type of plot you can think of.

I've included a lot of links at the end of these slides to explore the possibilities of `ggplot2` further. Strongly recommend you use them or at least save them somewhere.

&lt;img src="pics/plot_example2.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### The Magic of `ggplot2`

Using `ggplot2` to create plots is great because the **structure** it sets up makes plot creation intuitive.

.pull-left-wide[

``` r
ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) +
  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(
     mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;),
     stat = &lt;STAT&gt;,
     position = &lt;POSITION&gt;
  ) +
  &lt;SCALE_FUNTION&gt; +
  &lt;FACET_FUNCTION&gt; +
  &lt;THEME_FUNCTION&gt;
```
]

.pull-right-wide[
1. `Data`: The data that you want to visualize
2. `Layers`: geom\_ and stat\_ → The geometric shapes and statistical summaries representing the data
3. `Aesthetics`: aes() → Aesthetic mappings of the geometric and statistical objects
4. `Scales`: scale_ → Maps between the data and the aesthetic dimensions
5. `Facets`: facet_ → The arrangement of the data into a grid of plots
6. `Visual themes`: theme() and theme_ → The overall visual defaults of a plot
]

`cyl` categorizes cars by number of cylinders. Although the values are numbers, it is a **categorical** variable. We communicate this to `ggplot()` using the `factor()` function.

## Plot Standards

.content-box-blue[
1. Your plot should be &lt;font color = "red"&gt;**properly labeled**&lt;/font&gt;:
    - The plot should have a title describing its content
    - Axes should be labeled
    - Legend (if any) should have a title and labels
    
2. Your plot should be &lt;font color = "red"&gt;**properly formatted**&lt;/font&gt;:
    - Axis dimensions should be appropriate. What is appropriate varies depending on context, but usually you should aim to fill the plot space with data
    - Text size should be large enough for text to be legible
    
3. Your plot should be &lt;font color = "red"&gt;**self contained**&lt;/font&gt;. People should be able to understand your plot and its data without any other context or explanatory text. That means:
    - A caption note that includes data source and any important data construction notes
    - Title and subtitle that deliver the plot's *message*

## Data Visualization — Descriptive Statistics — Tables

---

## Descriptive Statistics Tables

Thankfully, not every RA position requires academic-standard tables or use of LateX.

It is still useful, however, to be able to communicate descriptive statistics about data.

There are countless R packages to help do this. Today, we're looking at the `gt` package. It's simple to use and it's very easy to create good-looking tables using it.

`gt` exports into .png, .pdf, or .html. You can add interactive elements, plots within columns.

&lt;img src="pics/gt_table_example.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Descriptive Statistics Table — Step-by-Step

We will mainly use the example in the script for this. To summarize, the steps are:

- Create a dataset you want to export

- Run the dataset through the `gt()` function to create a gt object

- Customize the table using functions from the `gt` package (see online for further things you can do). Examples of what you can do include:
    - Modify column names — `cols_label()`
    - Modify borders — `tab_style()`, `cell_borders()`
    - Add colors conditional on cell value — `data_color()`
    - Add title/subtitle — `tab_header()`

- Export the table using `gtsave()`

## Data Visualization — Simple Regression Table

---

### Regression Tables

Regression tables are very common in economic/policy analysis.

They're very simple to create using R and a software called **LateX** (pronounced latek).

Unless you're getting into academic research, you don't need to know how to properly use LateX. Just enough to:

- Export the LateX script from R
- Copy/paste it into a LateX-reading software, e.g. Overleaf
- Export the pdf or png to share

### Regression Table — Step by Step

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Run Regression in R]


``` r
# Simplest regression format in R

reg_example &lt;- lm(
    outcome_variable ~ independent_variable + control_variables,
    data = dataset
)

# Observe results

reg_example %&gt;% summary()
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Convert to Exportable Table]

Simply do one of these!


``` r
reg_example_ht &lt;- reg_example %&gt;%
    huxtable::huxreg()
```

OR


``` r
reg_example_sg &lt;- reg_example %&gt;%
    stargazer::stargazer() # Many options to make prettier
```

]

]

### Regression Table — Step by Step

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Export Huxtable Table]

Some simple options for the Huxtable table:


``` r
  huxtable::quick_latex(
      reg_example_ht,
      file = "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_ht.tex"
  )
  
  huxtable::quick_pdf
      reg_example_ht,
      file = "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_ht.pdf"
  )
  
  huxtable::quick_html(
      reg_example_ht,
      file = "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_ht.html"
  )
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Export Stargazer Table]


``` r
# You can export a LateX script using the 'writeLines' function

writeLines(
    reg_example_sg,
    "filepath/filepath/filepath/reg_example_sg.tex"
)
```

To visualize your table, the easiest solution is to:

- Create a free Overleaf account on [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com)
- Open a new document
- Copy/paste your .tex output in between the `begin{document}` and `end{document}` lines
- Click compile and then save!

You can also install the `tinytex` package and use `pdftolatex` to save a PDF file.
